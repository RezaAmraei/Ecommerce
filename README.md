# E-commerce

This is a project I have worked on where I at first followed a tutorial that taught me Next.js, Sanity.io, and Stripe. Then after finishing it I went back and made it my own by refactoring the code and adding my own styling to it.

## About

The purpose of this project was mainly to teach me new technologies, all the new methods I used were Next, Sanity, Stripe, and useContext. With these I built a fully functional e-commerce website that will allow the user to browse around and add items to a cart and to purchase them, while I would appreciate the free money I suggest you to not purchase anything because I am not actually selling these products.
